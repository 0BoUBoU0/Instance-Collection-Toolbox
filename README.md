- convert selection into a new instance collection : select all objects you want and create an Instance collection. Few options are available :
  - New Collection Name : Choose your name of your Instance Collection. By default, "Random ID" will create a name with 5 random letters
  - Use Collection Label (checked by default) : Will use the prefix set in the preferences (section later)
  - Collection Color (random by default) : Will change the color of the collection. If you want a defined color, change it
  - Keep Original Location (checked by default) : Will make the instance collection be at the same location which means nothing moves. If unchecked, the instance collection will be moved to the center of the world
  - Collection Center : Every Instance collection has a kind of origin. You can choose either World Origin, 2D Cursor, Collection Center, Collection center with Z on 0
  - Store in Asset Browser : it will automatically store the instance collection as an asset. The Asset Manager has to be opened to make it work

renaming from its data : the object or instance collection will be renamed regarding to its data (mesh or collection)
offset collection center from selection : the "center" of each selected objects' collection will be well set
convert meshes to instance collection : each selected object will be converted in an empty instance collection, which allows you to use collection instead of meshes
randomize elements : this tool will change randomly from your selection to element in a defined library

and many more to come ! (one day)
